Day 1:
1. Set up the github repository
    a) new environemt
        - "conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y"
        - do "y" so it loads when you open it and you don't need to continue to grant access
        - "conda activate /Users/hilpresent/Desktop/Portfolio/project_ml-project/venv" to activate virtual environment
    b) clone repository and sync with github
        - git init
        - git add README.md
            - I created an actual file in VS Code first and then executed the "git add README.md" command
        - git commit -m "first commit"
        - git branch -M main
        - git remote add origin https://github.com/hilpresent/ml-project.git
            - adding this makes sure local device is in sync with github repo
            - "git remote -v" will confirm that this project folder has been properly synced with your github repo
        - git push -u origin main
            - "git config --global user.email" to set email address if this is your first repo
            - can change email by typing "git config --global user.email <new_email_address>"
        - create .gitignore on github site
            - select "add a new file" and name it ".gitignore"
            - choose python as template
            - commit change
            - git pull on your local directory to get the .gitignore file
    c) setup.py and requirements.txt
        - create new file called setup.py
            - responsible in making machine learning application as a package
            - allows anybody to install this application as a package and use it themselves
        - create new file called requirements.txt
            - will hold information on all of the packages and libraries we will be using throughout this project
        - see files to see what needs to be added
2. src folder and build the package
    a) create "src" folder and add "__init__.py" file to tell setup.py where to read requirements from
    b) run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install libraries necessary for this project
            - indicates to run setup.py to build the project   
            - generates "ml_project.egg-info" folder with information on the project
            - top_level.txt -> finds src folder because that contains "__init__.py" file
            - requires.txt -> list of all requirements sans "-e ."
3. don't forget to "git add ." and "git commit" and "git push -u origin main"!
    a) note: the "-u" in "git push -u origin main" sets the upstream branch 
        - means git remembers the branch you are tracking
        - don't need to keep indicating remote and branch each time
        - streamlines for future use (can just say "git push" and "git pull")
